# multivariable-linear-regression
I built this Multivariable Linear Regression model to understand how gradient descent works when there are multiple input features.
-My work includes:
*Generated a dummy dataset with three input features
*Implemented multivariable linear regression using matrix operations
*Wrote my own cost function and gradient calculations
*Trained the model using gradient descent to learn the weight vector and bias

-Technologies used:
*Python
*NumPy (for matrix operations and calculations)
*Matplotlib (for plotting the cost curve)
